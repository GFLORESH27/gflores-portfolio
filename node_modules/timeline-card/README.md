Here's an example of how to use the `timeline-card` components:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {
  MainTimeline,
  VerticalTimeline1,
  VerticalTimeline2,
  VerticalTimeline3,
} from "timeline-card";
import "timeline-card/dist/index.css";

const App = () => {
  const timelineData = [
    {
      timelineType: "VerticalTimeline1",
      timelineItems: [
        {
          date: "2019-05-01",
          label: "Shopify acquired Handshake",
          description:
            "Shopify acquired Handshake, a business-to-business e-commerce platform for wholesale goods.",
        },
        {
          date: "2019-06-01",
          label: "Shopify announced Fulfilment Network launch",
          description:
            "Shopify announced the launch of its Fulfilment Network.",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      timelineType: "VerticalTimeline2",
      timelineItems: [
        {
          date: "2019-09-09",
          title: "Shopify acquired 6 River Systems",
          content:
            "Shopify announced the acquisition of 6 River Systems, a warehouse robotics company.",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      timelineType: "VerticalTimeline3",
      timelineItems: [
        {
          date: "2019-10-01",
          title: "Acquisition of 6 River Systems finalized",
          content:
            "The acquisition was finalized in a deal worth $450 million.",
        },
      ],
    },
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      <MainTimeline timelineData={timelineData} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Styling

The package includes built-in styling using Tailwind CSS. To ensure the styles are applied, make sure you import the CSS file in your project:

```javascript
import "timeline-card/dist/index.css";
```

### Customizing the Timeline

You can customize the timeline by passing different props or modifying the components directly:

- **Timeline Types:** Choose between different timeline layouts like `VerticalTimeline1`, `VerticalTimeline2`, and `VerticalTimeline3`.
- **Custom Icons:** Provide your own SVG paths to replace the default icons.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS classes or your own CSS to modify the appearance of the timeline.

### Example of a Timeline Item with a Custom Icon:

```jsx
const timelineItems = [
  {
    date: "2024-01-01",
    title: "New Year Celebration",
    content: "Celebrated the New Year with friends and family.",
    iconPath: "M10 20v-6h4v6h5v-8h3L12 3 2 12h3v8z", // Example SVG path
  },
];
```
